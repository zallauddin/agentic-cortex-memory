# Karpathy's LLM Coding Guidelines

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's observations on common LLM coding failures.
These rules prevent AI agents from making assumptions, overcomplicating code,
making unnecessary changes, and lacking rigorous success criteria.

## 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.
- **State assumptions explicitly.** If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, **stop**. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- **No features beyond what was asked.**
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, **rewrite it**.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
- When editing existing code: **Don't "improve" adjacent code**, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- **Match existing style**, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- When your changes create orphans: Remove imports/variables/functions that **YOUR changes** made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- **The test**: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals (e.g., "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass").
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan: [Step] → verify: [check].
- **Strong success criteria let agents loop independently**; weak criteria require constant clarification.
- Never mark a task complete without verifying the success criteria were met.
